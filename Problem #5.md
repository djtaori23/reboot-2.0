# Problem #5   
## Play with files and directories:

* #### Create 3 files named abc.txt ok fine g.txt under /tmp directory. 
* #### Create 4 directories a aa aaa aaaa  under  /tmp directory.
* #### Give ls command to list the content of /tmp directory and make sure it will only list the content (file|directory) having 2 char in their name.

### Answer:

•	Open terminal and type the following commands
•	cd /tmp
•	touch abc.txt ok\ fine g.txt
•	mkdir a aa aaa aaaa
•	ls -d ?? (This prints all files and directories having exactly 2 characters in their name)
